"""This package defines a Python interface for interacting with a Zeek cluster
controller. It provides a Controller class for sending and retrieving events, a
Zeek event abstraction on top of Broker, and various types that mirror those
defined in Zeek's policy/management/frameworks/management/types.zeek, needed
for request/response events.
